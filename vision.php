		<h3>Mission</h3>

		<p>
			The New School prepares students to understand, contribute to, <br />
			and succeed in a rapidly changing society, thus making the world a <br />
			better and more just place. We will ensure that our students <br />
			develop both the skills that a sound education provides and the
			competencies essential <br />
			for success and leadership in the emerging creative economy. We will also
			<br />
			lead in generating practical and theoretical knowledge that enables people
			to better understand our world and improve <br />
			conditions for local and global communities. <br />

		<h3>Vision</h3>
		<p>
			We are and will be a university where design and social research drive
			approaches to studying issues of our time, such as democracy,
			urbanization, technological change, economic empowerment, sustainability,
			<br />
			migration, and globalization. We will be the preeminent intellectual and
			<br />
			creative center for effective engagement in a world that increasingly
			demands better-designed objects, <br />
			communication, systems, and organizations to meet social needs. <br />
			<br />
			Our vision aligns with shifts in the global economy, society, and
			environment, which animates our mission and our values: <br />
			<br />

			#Creativity, innovation, and a desire to challenge the status quo will
			affect what and how we teach and the intellectual ambitions of the
			university itself. <br />
			#Social engagement should orient students' academic experiences to help
			them become critically engaged citizens, dedicated to solving problems and
			contributing to the public good. <br />
			#The New School must embrace these principles and innovate to address
			shifts in the global economy, <br />
			society, and environment that require individuals to grapple with complex
			problems, <br />
			pursue more fluid and flexible career pathways, and collaboratively create
			change. <br />
